# 3D Shirt Design Customization via AI — Web Application

A web application for customizing 3D shirt designs using AI. Users can generate, preview, download, and manipulate designs, then visualize them on 3D shirt mockups. Built with JavaScript, React, and Node.js.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- **AI-powered design generation** — Create graphics or patterns via AI prompts (e.g. text or image-based).  
- **3D preview / mockup** — View designs wrapped on a shirt model in 3D, to see how they look from different angles.  
- **Design editing / customization** — Adjust or replace generated designs; change colors, layouts, possibly textures.  
- **Backend services** — Handle AI generation, design storage or processing, and serve to the frontend.

## 📁 Repository Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `react/` | Frontend code (React app) — UI, rendering, user interactions. |
| `server/` | Backend (Node.js / Express or similar) — APIs for AI model calls, data handling, probably mockup generation. |
| `node_modules/` | Libraries and dependencies for both frontend and backend. (Ignored in version control.) |
| `.gitignore` | Specifies files/folders to ignore (e.g. `node_modules`). |
| `package.json` / `package-lock.json` | Dependency info, scripts, metadata. |

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (JavaScript)  
- **Backend**: Node.js (JavaScript)  
- **AI / ML**: (inferred) some image generation / processing model(s) or services  
- **3D View / Rendering**: WebGL / Three.js / other library (if implemented)  
- **Design / Assets**: likely image files, texture maps, maybe vector graphics

## 🛠 Installation & Setup

Below is a suggested setup flow. (Some details may need to be filled in based on what’s actually in the code.)

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/baraakilany/3D-shirt-design-customization-via-AI---WEB-APPLICATION.git
   cd 3D-shirt-design-customization-via-AI---WEB-APPLICATION
Install dependencies

For both frontend and backend:

bash
Copy code
cd react
npm install
cd ../server
npm install
Configure environment variables

Create .env files in the server (and possibly frontend) directories. Variables may include:

AI model API key(s)

Endpoint URLs

Port numbers

Storage paths

Run the application

Start backend server (e.g. npm start or node index.js)

Start frontend (e.g. npm start in the react/ folder)

Visit http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port is used) in your browser

🎯 Usage
Use the UI to enter prompts or upload images to generate design elements.

Adjust controls (colors, layout, scale) to customize the design.

Preview on a 3D shirt mockup—they can rotate, zoom to see how the design wraps.

Export or save the final design (image file / mockup).

🔍 What’s Missing / To Be Improved
Here are some areas that may need additional work or clarification:

Explicit instructions in code & environment config (README currently lacks details).

Details about which AI model(s) are used, how they are integrated (local vs. cloud).

Handling performance / latency for design generation.

Support for different shirt types, materials, textures.

Tests & documentation for UI & backend API endpoints.

Deployment instructions (how to host, build for production).

🙋 Contribution
If you’d like to contribute:

Fork the repo.

Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName.

Make your changes; ensure consistent code style.

Document any new APIs or UI changes.

Submit a Pull Request with a clear description of what you added/changed and why.

✅ Summary
This project is poised to deliver a user-friendly interface for designing and previewing 3D shirt graphics with AI. With a few additions—especially around documentation, configuration, and deployment—it could be made quite polished and production-ready.
